Contents
we use three algorithms from the naive bayes model in other to pick the best alroithm we compare the score of the various algorithm which are:
MultinomialNB(Multinomial Naive Bayes)

With CountVectorizer the metrics that were obtain in this algorithm are as follow; 
Maximum Accurancy: 77.85%, 
Minimum Accurancy: 70.67, 
Mean Accurancy: 7.5e+01%, 
Std accurancy: 2.45%

with Tfidf the metrics that were obrain in this algorithm are 
Maximum accuracy: 82.55%, 
Minimum Accuracy: 75.17%, 
Mean_accuracy: 78.34%, 
Std_accuracy: 2.62%
BernuolliNB(Bernuolli Naive Bayes)

with CountVectorizer the metrics that were achieved are 
Maximum accuracy: 79.19%, 
Minimum Accuracy: 71.33%, 
Mean_accuracy: 75.13%, 
Std_accuracy: 3.08%

With Tfidf the metrics that where obtained in this algorithm are; 
Maximum accuracy: 79.19%, 
Minimum Accuracy: 71.33%, 
Mean_accuracy: 75.13%, 
Std_accuracy: 3.08%

ComplementNB((Multinomial Naive Bayes))
with CountVectorizer the metrics that were obtained are 
Maximum Accurancy: 78.67%, 
Minimum Accurancy: 70.67%, 
Mean Accurancy: 7.4e+01%, 
Std accurancy: 2.55%

With Tfidf the metrics that were obtain are 
Maximum Accurancy: 81.21%, 
Minimum Accurancy: 75.17%, 
Mean Accurancy: 7.8e+01%, 
Std accurancy: 2.13%
From the above model we can see that Complement naive bayes has the highest accurancy compare to the other which goes to show that Complement Naive Bayes is more able to predict better than the other. So in that case we are going to be working with the complement naive bayes to check if a text is Positive or Negative
